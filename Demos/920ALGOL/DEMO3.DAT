   ~comment~ 9-FEB-2011: this program must be input as unicode for correct handling of 
                          special characters;
	
   ~integer~ m; ~integer~ ~array~ a[1:30];
   reader(1); punch(3);
   m := 1; instring(a, m);
   m := 1; outstring(a, m);
   ~print~ ''L`Special symbols ~ ‘QSU’ ( ) , £ : & * / = + - . ; [ ] < > ↑ % ?`;

   ~comment~ In INNER strings
             L means Carriage Return Line Feed
             S means Space
             R means Runout
             Q means Quote
             U means Unquote
             H means Halt Code
     Any of these followed by a small integer repeats the
     character that many times, and
             B means output a single character with the value
               of the small integer which follows it, eg B33
               is Exclamation Mark;
   ~print~ ''LS2RLS3QQQLS4UUULS5HL``;
