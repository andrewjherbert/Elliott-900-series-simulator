Independent compilation - 15-MAR-2005

G.ALG is the procedure to be compiled and used independently as part
of demo3.dat. When the initial jump is to 8 instead of 17 and OPASC
replaces OPBIN, it compiles and runs all right. With OPBIN and JUMP 17
you get G.LIS.

Append G.LIS to MODULE.DAT and run it. You get G.BIN which can be added
to LIBRARY.DAT, replacing the final line containing 112 at the end by
a line of all 0s (at least ten of them).
