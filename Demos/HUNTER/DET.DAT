      "comment" This is adapted from AP204 written by T.J. Dekker 
                at the Matematisch Centrum in 1963.
                DET := determinant on the N-th order matrix given in
                array A[1:N,1:N]. The first index of the array 
                elements is the row, the second is the column index 
                as usual. The method is triangular decomposition
                according to Crout with row interchanges. This process
                yields a lower triangle L and a unit upper triangle
                U such that L*U equals matrix A with interchanged
                rows. Together with each row interchange the sign of
                the non-pivotal row is reversed, so that the
                determinant equals the product of the diagonal
                elements of L. At each stage the pivot is chosen in a
                column of L such that its modulus divided by the
                Euclidean norm of the corresponding row of A is 
                maximal. The integer array P[1:N] is an output vector
                in which the pivotal row indices are recorded. The
                elements of A are replaced by the corresponding
                calculated elements of L and U. So enough information
                is retained for subsequent solution of linear systems
                and for matrix inversion;
